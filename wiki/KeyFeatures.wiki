#summary Full list of features I can think of, with estimates

= Introduction =

As you can see now I don't even know what can be done in many areas, so direct me in comments to this page.

= THE =

|| *Feature* || *Explanation, Estimate* ||
|| Make the application fully skinnable || Shouldn't take more than a day per view. For now the hardest piece is finished: the board itself is fully skinnable. I think it's enough for v.1. ||
|| Make it easy and natural to play by LAN || 80% is done. The last 20% should take 5 more time :) For the first release I've decided to restrict LAN with just one-to-one game. That reqieres 2-3 days of restricting ||
|| Localize everything (e.g. in russian) || Didn't started yet. Might take a month ||
|| Make a skin with non-japanese symbols || You can find an example [http://www.chessvariants.org/shogi.html here. Look at the right edge of the screen]. This might be useful for "the rest world" to simplify studying shogi. I didn't started yet. It might take a week. Althogh I've already made a skin ("red") which colors black and white pieces differen. ||
|| Game should give very clear messages for invalid moves || Practically done. Although some skinning is still requiered. ||
|| App should support "analyse a game" scenario || That means it should be easy and natural to load game transcript, relpay it, comment it, run AI to analyse some branches, whatsoever. *Need a clarification: what exactly soever?* ||
